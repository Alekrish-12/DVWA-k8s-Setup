## Setup Instructions

### Install Minikube

To install Minikube, run the following script:

bash setup-scripts/install-minikube.sh

Start Minikube-Start Minikube to create a local Kubernetes cluster: 
bash setup-scripts/start-minikube.sh

Install kubectl-To install kubectl, run the following script:
bash setup-scripts/install-kubectl.sh

Verify the installation with:
kubectl version --client

### Deploy DVWA
Create Deployment and Service Files
Create a file named dvwa-deployment.yaml with the following content:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dvwa
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dvwa
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dvwa
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: dvwa
        image: vulnerables/web-dvwa
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

Deploy DVWA
Apply the deployment with:
kubectl apply -f dvwa-deployment.yaml

Access DVWA
To access DVWA, use the Minikube service command:
minikube service dvwa-service
This will open a browser window with the DVWA login page.

### Demonstrate Attack Vectors
SQL Injection
Attack Vector: SQL Injection

Steps:
Open the DVWA login page in your browser (provided by Minikube service command).
In the login form, enter the following payload in the username field: ' OR 1=1 --.
Leave the password field empty.
Click "Login."
Observation: The payload bypasses authentication, indicating an SQL Injection vulnerability.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Attack Vector: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Steps:
Navigate to the ‚ÄúXSS (Stored)‚Äù section in DVWA.
In the message field, enter the following payload: <script>alert('XSS')</script>.
Submit the form.
Observation: An alert box pops up when the page is loaded, indicating an XSS vulnerability.

Command Injection
Attack Vector: Command Injection

Steps:
Navigate to the ‚ÄúCommand Injection‚Äù section in DVWA.
In the input field, enter the following payload: ; ls -la.
Submit the form.
Observation: The directory listing of the server is displayed, indicating a command injection vulnerability.
